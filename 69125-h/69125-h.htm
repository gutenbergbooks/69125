<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> any inquiry of a practical nature,
intended to lead to some
definite course of action, it is
obviously necessary to start with a tolerably
clear idea of the end in view—the
object for which it is proposed to provide.
In the case of education, definitions
more or less satisfactory have already so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
often been given, that it might seem
superfluous to go into the question again.
As a matter of practice, however, it is
found that, when it is attempted to apply
the received definitions of the general objects
of education to the case of women,
they are usually questioned or modified,
if not altogether set aside. When, for
instance, Mr Maurice tells us that ‘the
end of education itself is, as it has always
been considered, to form a nation of living,
orderly men,’ the definition will be
accepted, with the tacit reservation that
it applies only to men, in the exclusive
sense of the word, and has nothing to do
with the education of women. Again,
when Milton, in his treatise on Education,
lays down that the end of learning is ‘to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
repair the ruin of our first parents by regaining
to know God aright, and out of
that knowledge to love Him, to imitate
Him, to be like Him,’ the language might
be taken in a general sense; and when he
goes on to define a complete and generous
education as ‘that which fits a man to
perform justly, skilfully, and magnanimously
all the offices, both private and
public, of peace and war,’ the words
might still, perhaps, bear a common interpretation;
but as soon as he comes to
describing in detail, ‘how all this may
be done between twelve and one-and-twenty,’
it becomes evident that he is
thinking of boys only. In the most
recent writers, the tendency to regard
general theories of education as applying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
exclusively to that of men, is quite as
strongly marked.</p>

<p>It seems, therefore, that in attempting
to treat of female education, it is necessary
once more to ask what we are aiming
at, and to obtain, if possible, a clear
understanding and agreement as to the
end in view. What ought the educators
of girls to be trying to make of them?
What is the ideal towards which they
ought to direct their efforts, the end to
be desired as the result of their labours?</p>

<p>To these questions we shall probably
receive one or other of two answers.
Many persons will reply, without hesitation,
that the one object to be aimed at,
the ideal to be striven after, in the education
of women, is to make good wives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
and mothers. And the answer is a reasonable
one, so far as it goes, and with
explanations. Clearly, no education would
be good which did not tend to make good
wives and mothers; and that which produces
the best wives and mothers is likely
to be the best possible education. But,
having made this admission, it is necessary
to point out that an education of
which the aim is thus limited, is likely
to fail in that aim. That this is so will
appear when the definition is transferred
to the education of men. It will be admitted
that a system of education which
should produce bad husbands and fathers
would prove itself to be bad; and an
education which produces the best husbands
and fathers is likely to be in all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
respects the best; because the best man
in any capacity must be the man who
can measure most accurately the proportion
of all his duties and claims, giving
to each its due share of his time and
energy. A man will not be the better
husband and father for neglecting his
obligations as a citizen, or as a man of
business. Nor will a woman be the
better wife or mother through ignorance
or disregard of other responsibilities.
There is, indeed, a view of male education
which, having worldly advancement
for its ultimate object, regards it exclusively
as a means of acquiring professional
dexterity; but such a conception
of the purposes of education—however
legitimate, in a limited and subordinate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
sense—when elevated into the position
of the final goal, must be looked upon
rather as a lapse from a higher standard,
than as a principle deliberately maintained
by any high-minded and thoughtful
person. In disinterested schemes of
male education, it is usually assumed, as a
matter of course, that the great object is
to make the best of a man in every respect,
leaving him to adapt himself to
specific relations, according to the state
of life into which it shall please God
to call him.</p>

<p>A similar idea seems to underlie the
other, and more comprehensive reply,
which will probably be given to our inquiry,
namely, that the object of female
education is to produce women of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
best and highest type, not limited by
exclusive regard to any specific functions
hereafter to be discharged by them. This
answer at once brings down upon us
the terrible question, What is the best
and highest type of woman? And as
this question lies at the root of the
whole matter, it cannot be passed by.
Many people, indeed, talk as if it was
a matter on which the world had long
since made up its mind, and which might
be assumed to be already decided. But
when we ask what it is that the world
has decided, it is difficult to obtain anything
like a clear and unanimous answer.
The ideal differs not only among different
races, and in different ages, but most
widely in our own country, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
modern times. Unanimity is scarcely
to be found in any class of writers or
thinkers, though on this point, of all
others, some sort of agreement, at least
between parents and teachers, would
seem to be most essential. It may perhaps
be of service, as a step towards a
mutual understanding, to examine, though
necessarily in a very imperfect and cursory
manner, some of the most commonly
received notions current on the subject.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">There</span> is a theory afloat, extensively
prevalent, and probably
influencing many persons who
have never stated it definitely to themselves,
that the human ideal is composed
of two elements, the male and the female,
each requiring the other as its complement;
and that the realisation of this
ideal is to be found in no single human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
being, man or woman, but in the union
of individuals by marriage, or by some
sort of vague marriage of the whole race.
The conception of character which rests
on the broad basis of a common humanity
falls into the background, and there
is substituted for it a dual theory, with
distinctly different forms of male and
female excellence. Persons who take
this view are naturally governed by
it in their conceptions of what women
ought to be. Having framed a more
or less definite idea of the masculine
character, in constructing the feminine
helpmeet they look out, if not for the
directly opposite, for what they would
call the complementary qualities, and the
conclusion quickly follows, that whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
is manly must be unwomanly, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice
versâ</i>. The advocates of this view usually
hold in connexion with it certain doctrines,
such as, that the man is intended
for the world, woman for the home;
man’s strength is in the head, woman’s
in the heart; the man’s function is to
protect, woman’s to soothe and comfort;
men must work, and women must weep:
everywhere we are to have a sharply
marked division, often honestly mistaken
for the highest and most real communion.
Closely connected with these separatist
doctrines is the double moral code, with
its masculine and feminine virtues, and
its separate law of duty and honour for
either sex.</p>

<p>The general acceptance of the theory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
is not surprising. It gratifies the logical
instinct; and many persons, hastily taking
for granted that it is the only conception
of the relations between men and
women which recognises real distinctions,
assume it to be the only one which satisfies
the craving of the æsthetic sense for
harmony and fitness. Unfortunately it
is not workable. We make the world
even more puzzling than it is by nature,
when we shut our eyes to the facts of
daily life; and we know, as a fact, that
women have a part in the world, and
that men are by no means ciphers in the
home circle—we know that a man who
should be all head would be as monstrous
an anomaly as a woman all heart—that
men require the protection of law, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
women are not so uniformly prosperous
as to be independent of comfort and
consolation—men have no monopoly of
working, nor women of weeping. The
sort of distinction it is attempted to
establish, though not without an element
of truth when rightly understood, is for
the most part artificial, plausible in appearance,
but breaking down under the
test of experience. When overstrained,
and made the foundation of a divided
moral code, it is misleading in proportion
to its attractiveness.</p>

<p>Happily this theory, though deeply and
widely and most subtilely influential, is
not completely dominant. People who go
to church, and who read their Bibles, are
perpetually reminded of one type and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
exemplar, one moral law. The theory of
education of our English Church recognises
no distinction of sex. The baptized
child is signed with the sign of the cross,
‘in token that hereafter he—or she—shall
not be ashamed to confess the faith of
Christ crucified, and manfully to fight
under His banner, against sin, the world,
and the devil; and to continue Christ’s
faithful soldier and servant to his—or her—life’s
end.’ The sponsors are charged to provide
that the child be ‘virtuously brought
up to lead a godly and a Christian life,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
remembering always that baptism doth represent
unto us our profession, which is to
follow the example of our Saviour Christ,
and to be made like unto Him.’ The
catechism in which the child is to be
instructed, gives no hint of separate standards
of duty. The catechumens are
required to give an account of their duty
towards God and towards their neighbour.
The latter supplies a statement
of social obligations, in which, if anywhere,
we should surely find a distinction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
laid down between the duties of men and
those of women. But no such distinction
appears. In Confirmation, the children,
having come to years of discretion, ratify
and confirm in their own persons what has
gone before, still without a hint of divergent
duties. The same principle appears
in the formularies of the Scotch Church.
The Shorter Catechism teaches that ‘God
created man, male and female, after His
own image, in knowledge, righteousness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
and holiness, with dominion over the
creatures;’ and that ‘man’s chief end is
to glorify God, and to enjoy Him for ever.’</p>

<p>Here all is clear and consistent. Thoroughly
to carry out the Christian theory
would no doubt lead to some startling consequences;
but the theory itself is intelligible
and workable. Can the same be said
of any other of the standards or tests by
which educators might shape their work?
The only intelligible principle on which
modern writers show anything like unanimity,
is that women are intended to
supply, and ought to be made, something
which men want. What that may be, it
is not easy to discover. We are met at
the outset by a difficulty as to the nature
of the want. We may want what we
like, or we may want what will do us
good—and the two qualities are not
always combined. Usually, however, it
is taken for granted that, in this case,
men like what is good for them; and it
only remains, therefore, to be ascertained
what it is that they like.</p>

<p>There is no lack of evidence. English
literature is full of oracular information
on the subject. Mr Anthony Trollope
says: ‘We like women to be timid.’
Mr Helps complains that ‘women are
not taught to be courageous. Indeed, to
some persons courage may seem as unnecessary
for women as Latin and Greek.
Yet there are few things that would tend
to make women happier in themselves,
and more acceptable to those with whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
they live, than courage.... So far
from courage being unfeminine, there is
a peculiar grace and dignity in those
beings who have little active power of
attack or defence, passing through danger
with a moral courage which is equal to
that of the strongest.’</p>

<p>Abundance of applause has been bestowed
upon Miss Nightingale and the
other ‘heroines of the Crimea,’ whose enterprise
certainly required no small share
of masculine resolution. On the other
hand, a writer on the position of women
confesses to ‘an admiration for the commonplace,
unambitious kind of old maid,
who is content to do good in her own
neighbourhood, and among the few persons
whom she really knows—who takes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
a lively interest in the welfare of her
nephews and nieces, and who regales herself
occasionally with tea and gossip.’</p>

<p>One writer tells us that there are things
for which women are exclusively fitted.
‘In the first place, women have the power
of pleasing. Accomplishments are cultivated
as instrumental to the successful
exercise of this power, and therefore are
not to be rejected on the ground that they
waste the time that might be given to
mathematics. The common sense of the
world has long ago settled that men are
to be pleased, and women are to please.
Accordingly women acquire an agreeable
expertness at the piano, and view the
acquisition as a solemn duty.’ Another,
in answer to the question, what ought all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
young ladies to learn, says, ‘Accomplishments
are quite a secondary matter. If
men do not get tired of the songs, they
soon get tired of the singer, if she can do
nothing but sing. What is really wanted
in a woman is, that she should be a permanently
pleasant companion. So far as
education can give or enhance pleasantness,
it does so by making the view of life
wide, the wit ready, the faculty of comprehension
vivid.’</p>

<p>One authority, delightfully contented
with things as they are, assures us that,
‘humanly speaking, the best sort of British
young lady is all that a woman can
be expected to be—civil, intelligent, enthusiastic,
decorous, and, as a rule, prettier
than in any other country. We are perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
satisfied with what we have got.’ Another,
less happily constituted, asserts that
‘all good judges and good teachers lament
the present system of girls’ education. It
is all cramming, and with such very poor
results. After all is over, girls know very
little and care about less. Most girls are
decidedly stupid, and what good can
cramming of the most barren and repulsive
kind do to stupid girls? We should
consider what we want women to be.
That they should be trained to be good
and generous is by far the first thing....
The next thing is that they should be well-mannered
and healthy. The third requisite
is, that they should know how to
express themselves—should have a right
standard in judging books and men, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
public and private life.... The fourth
requisite is, that they should know how to
bear rule in a household.... These are all
the essentials.’</p>

<p>Another view is, that a woman should
be ‘a gentle tyrant, capricious indeed, yet
generous and kindhearted withal, varying
in mood, now clouded, now serene, though
given less to tears than laughter, and
bright with gleams of hopeful sunshine
like the spring. She should be no dunce,
no ignoramus, this enviable woman; she
should not have stopped in her education
when the governess’s back was turned, nor
hold that to play Mr Chappell’s music
creditably is the one aim and end of all
instruction; she should know enough to
take her part in topics of general conversation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
to read the <i>Times</i> with interest,
and talk about the leading article without
a yawn; she should be fond enough
of learning to find that her leisure seldom
hangs heavy on her hands; and if (though
it is almost too much to expect) she has
sufficient patience with the process of induction
to be able to reason on any subject
for two minutes together without jumping
to a conclusion either way, we may well
congratulate ourselves on having drawn
the great prize in the lottery of life.’ Mr
Coventry Patmore seems to prefer that
the gentle tyranny and the capriciousness
should be on the other side.</p>

<p>This picture of trembling devotion, of
‘distrust qualified by fear,’ appears in a
selection called ‘Beautiful Poetry,’ under
the heading ‘A True Wife.’ But this
kind of wife would be positively disliked
by some husbands. It has been said that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
‘perhaps—such is masculine nature—a
wife with more knowledge, more fixity of
thought, and more general mental power
than one’s-self might be “a blessing in disguise.”
But one who is goose enough to
sympathise at random on subjects of which
she knows little or nothing, because it is
“feminine” to do so, is a nuisance <em>not</em> in
disguise.... For our own part, we would
just as soon have the sympathy of a chameleon
as that of a woman who lives completely
in particulars, and is quite destitute
of power to appreciate a universal principle.’</p>

<p>These are but a few samples, culled
almost at random from the mass of contradictory
evidence to be found in English
literature. Conceive a governess or schoolmistress,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
duly impressed with the obligation
of training her pupils to be accomplished
pleasers of men, and trying to fashion for
them a model out of such materials! Must
not the result be simply blank despair?
The same conclusion might be reached by
a shorter process. Men are supposed to
marry the sort of women they like. But
looking upon the infinite variety of wives
to be met with in society, could any one
generalise from them a model wife, who
might serve as a pattern to educators?
Would any man wish for a wife so modelled?
Might it not be as well to abandon
this distracting theory—to discard the
shifting standard of opinion, and to fall
back upon the old doctrine which teaches
educators to seek in every human soul for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
that divine image which it is their work
to call out and to develope?</p>

<p>The educational question depends, as
we have seen, on the larger question of
women’s place in the social order. Are
they to be regarded, and to regard themselves,
primarily as children of God, members
of Christ, and heirs of the kingdom of
heaven, and, secondarily, as wives, mothers,
daughters, sisters? or are the family relationships
to overshadow the divine and
the social, and to be made the basis of a
special moral code, applying to women
only? According to the first view, all
human duties—everything that is lovely
and of good report—all moral virtues and
all Christian graces are inculcated and
enforced by the highest sanctions. An<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
ascetic contempt for wifely and motherly
and daughterly ties is no part of the
Christian ideal. But the view which
teaches women to think of family claims
as embracing their whole duty—which
bids them choose to serve man rather than
God—sets before them a standard of obligation
which, in proportion as it is exclusively
adhered to, vitiates not their lives
only, but those of the men on whom their
influence might be of a far different sort.
That such a theory is radically inconsistent
with the divine order might easily be
shown. That its action on society is profoundly
demoralising is a lesson taught
by mournful experience.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Whether</span> it is owing to the prevailing
confusion of ideas as to
the objects of female education,
or to whatever cause it may be attributed,
there can be little doubt that the thing
itself is held in slight esteem. No one
indeed would go so far as to say that it is
not worth while to educate girls at all.
<em>Some</em> education is held to be indispensable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
but how much is an open question;
and the general indifference operates in
the way of continually postponing it to
other claims, and, above all, in shortening
the time allotted to systematic instruction
and discipline. Parents are ready to make
sacrifices to secure a tolerably good and
complete education for their sons; they
do not consider it necessary to do the
same for their daughters. Or perhaps it
would be putting it more fairly to say,
that a very brief and attenuated course of
instruction, beginning late and ending
early, is believed to constitute a good and
complete education for a woman.</p>

<p>It is usually assumed that when a boy’s
school education has once begun, which
it does at a very early age, it is to go on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
steadily till he is a man. A boy who leaves
school at sixteen or eighteen, either enters
upon some technical course of training for
a business or profession, or he passes on to
the University, and from thence to active
work of some sort or other. In other
words, he is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in statu pupillari</i> until general
education and professional instruction
are superseded by the larger education
supplied by the business of life. In the
education of girls no such regular order
appears. A very usual course seems to
be for girls to spend their early years in a
haphazard kind of way, either at home,
or in not very regular attendance at an
inferior school; after which they are sent
for a year or two to a school or college to
finish. The heads of schools complain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
with one voice that they are called upon
to ‘finish’ what has never been begun,
and that to attempt to give anything like
a sound education, in the short time at
their disposal, is perfectly hopeless. But,
to take the most favourable case,—that of
a girl so well prepared that she is able to
make good use of the teaching provided in
a first-rate school,—just at the moment
when she is making real, substantial progress,
she is taken away. At sixteen,
seventeen, or eighteen, as the case may be,
her education comes to an abrupt pause.
When she marries, it may be said to begin
again; but between leaving school and
marriage there is usually an interval of at
least three or four years, if not a much
longer period. These years a youth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
spends, as has been before said, in preparation
for his future career. In the case
of girls, no such preparation seems to be
considered necessary.</p>

<p>Is this reasonable? Apart from immediate
pecuniary necessity, is it desirable
that the regular education of women
should be considered as finished at the
age of eighteen? If we are to take the
almost universal practice as an answer, it
is a very decided affirmative. Even girls
whose parents must be fully aware that
they will eventually have to maintain themselves,
seldom receive any adequate training
for their future work. Those whose
fathers intend to provide for them, are still
less likely to be supposed to want any
further education after they leave school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>So fixed and wide-spread a custom must
have had, at some time or other, even if it
has not now, a meaning and a justification.
And this may perhaps be found in the fact
that our mothers and our grandmothers
were accustomed to undergo at home,
after leaving school, what was in fact an
apprenticeship to household management.
It seems indeed at one time to have been
customary to apprentice girls of what we
now call the middle class, to trades,—as
we find George Herbert urging his Country
Parson not to put his children ‘into vain
trades and unbefitting the reverence of
their father’s calling, such as are taverns for
men and lacemaking for women,’—but
even where there was no apprenticeship to
a specific business, the round of household<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
labours would supply a very considerable
variety of useful occupation.
An active part in these labours would
naturally devolve upon the daughters of
the house, who would thus be forming
habits of industry and order invaluable in
after life.</p>

<p>Probably a great many fathers, profoundly
ignorant as they are of the lives
of women, cherish a vague imagination
that the same kind of thing is going on
still. If Providence should at any time
lead them to spend a week in the society
of their daughters, under ordinary circumstances—not
when illness has altered
the usual current of affairs—they would
find that this is very far from being the
case. That great male public, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
spends its days in chambers and offices
and shops, knows little of what is going
on at home. Writers in newspapers and
magazines are fond of talking about the
nursery, as if every household contained
a never-ending supply of young children,
on whom the grown-up daughters might
be practising the art of bringing up.
Others have a great deal to say about
the kitchen, assuming it to be desirable
that the ladies of the house should supersede,
or at least assist, the cook. In that
case, where there is a mother with two or
three daughters, we should have four or
five cooks. The undesirableness of such
a multiplication of artists need scarcely
be pointed out.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Needlework, again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
occupies a much larger space in the imagination
of writers than it does in practical
life. Except in families where there
are children, there is very little plain
needlework to be done, and what there
is, many people make a point of giving
out, on the ground that it is better to
pay a half-starved needlewoman for work
done, than to give her the money in the
form of alms.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>
<p>Having mentioned needlework, cookery,
and the care of children, we seem to have
come to an end of the household work in
which ladies are supposed to take part. If
young women of eighteen and upwards
are learning anything in their daily life at
home, it must be something beside and
beyond the acquirement of dexterity in
ordinary domestic arts.</p>

<p>Many fathers, however, are no doubt
aware that their daughters have very little
to do. But that seems to them anything
but a hardship. They wish they had a
little less to do themselves, and can imagine
all sorts of interesting pursuits to
which they would betake themselves if
only they had a little more leisure. Ladies,
it may be said, have their choice, and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
must evidently prefer idleness, or they
would find something to do. If this
means that half-educated young women
do not choose steady work when they
have no inducement whatever to overcome
natural indolence, it is no doubt true.
Women are not stronger-minded than
men, and a commonplace young woman
can no more work steadily without motive
or discipline than a commonplace young
man. It has been remarked that ‘the
active, voluntary part of man is very
small, and if it were not economised by a
sleepy kind of habit, its results would be
null. We could not do every day out of
our own heads all we have to do. We
should accomplish nothing; for all our
energies would be frittered away in minor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
attempts at petty improvement.’ The case
of young women could scarcely have been
better stated. Every day they have to do
out of their own heads nearly all that they
have to do. They accomplish little; for
their energies are frittered away in minor
attempts at petty improvement.</p>

<p>How true this is, the friends and counsellors
of girls could abundantly testify.
There is no point on which schoolmistresses
are more unanimous and more emphatic
than on the difficulty of knowing what to
do with girls after leaving school. People
who have not been brought into intimate
converse with young women have little
idea of the extent to which they suffer
from perplexities of conscience. ‘The
discontent of the modern girl’ is not mere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
idle self-torture. Busy men and women—and
people with disciplined minds—can
only, by a certain strain of the imagination,
conceive the situation. If they at all
entered into it, they could not have the
heart to talk as they do. For the case of
the modern girl is peculiarly hard in this,
that she has fallen upon an age in which
idleness is accounted disgraceful. The
social atmosphere rings with exhortations
to act, act in the living present. Everywhere
we hear that true happiness is to be
found in work—that there can be no leisure
without toil—that people who do
nothing are unfruitful fig-trees which
cumber the ground. And in this atmosphere
the modern girl lives and breathes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
She is not a stone, and she does not live
underground. She hears people talk—she
listens to sermons—she reads books. And
in her reading she comes across such passages
as the following:—</p>

<p>‘It is a real pleasure to me to find that
you are taking steadily to a profession,
without which I scarcely see how a man
can live honestly. That is, I use the term
“profession” in rather a large sense, not
as simply denoting certain callings which
a man follows for his maintenance, but
rather a definite field of duty, which the
nobleman has as much as the tailor, but
which he has not, who having an income
large enough to keep him from starving,
hangs about upon life, merely following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
his own caprices and fancies; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod factu
pessimum est</i>.’<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Or again:—</p>

<p xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">‘N’est-il pas vrai que la fadeur de la
vie est à la fois le grand malheur et le grand
danger? Il y a une douzaine d’années,
un orateur s’écriait à la tribune: “La
France s’ennuie.” Et moi je dis: L’humanité
s’ennuie, et son ennui ne date ni
d’aujourd’hui ni d’hier, quoique peut-être
il n’ait jamais été plus visible qu’en ce
moment. Sans la poursuite d’un but
idéal, toute vie devient inevitablement insipide,
même jusqu’au dégout. Or, comptez
parmi vos connaissances les personnes
qui poursuivent un but élevé. Beaucoup<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
vivent sans savoir pourquoi, uniquement,
je pense, parce que chaque matin ramène
le soleil. Que de femmes, si vous exceptez
les mères qui se donnent à leur famille,
que de femmes, hélas, dont la vie se passe
entière dans de futiles occupations, ou dans
des conversations plus futiles encore! Et
l’on s’étonne que, rongées d’ennui, elles
recherchent avec frénésie toutes les distractions
imaginables! Elles accusent la
monotonie de leur existence d’être la cause
de ce vague malaise; la vraie cause est
ailleurs, elle est dans la fadeur intolérable,
non d’une vie dépourvue d’événements et
d’aventures, mais d’une vie dont on n’entrevoit
pas la raison ni le but. On se
sent vivre sans qu’on y soit pour quelque
chose, et cette vie inconsciente, inutile,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
absurde, inspire un mécontentement trop
fondé.’<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Such things the modern girl reads, and
every word is confirmed by her own experience.
With the practical English
mind, which she has inherited from her
father, she applies it all to herself. She
seeks for counsel, and she finds it. She
is bidden to ‘look around her’—to do
the duty that lies nearest—to teach in
the schools, or visit the poor—to take up
a pursuit—to lay down a course of study
and stick to it. She looks around her,
and sees no particular call to active exertion.
The duties that lie in the way
are swallowed up by an energetic mother
or elder sister; very possibly she has no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
vocation for philanthropy—and the most
devoted philanthropists are the most
urgent in warning off people who lack
the vocation—or she lives in a village
where the children are better taught than
she could teach them, and the poor are
already too much visited by the clergyman’s
family; she feels no sort of impulse
to take up any particular pursuit, or to
follow out a course of study; and so long
as she is quiet and amiable, and does not
get out of health, nobody wants her to do
anything. Her relations and friends—her
world—are quite satisfied that she
should ‘hang about upon life, merely
following her own’—or their own—‘caprices
and fancies.’ The advice given,
so easy to offer, so hard to follow, presupposes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
exactly what is wanting, a
formed and disciplined character, able to
stand alone, and to follow steadily a
predetermined course, without fear of
punishment, or hope of reward. Ought
we to wonder if, in the great majority of
cases, girls let themselves go drifting
down the stream, despising themselves,
but listlessly yielding to what seems to be
their fate?</p>

<p>An appeal to natural guides is most
often either summarily dismissed, or received
with reproachful astonishment. It
is considered a just cause for surprise and
disappointment, that well brought up
girls, surrounded with all the comforts of
home, should have a wish or a thought
extending beyond its precincts. And,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
perhaps, it is only natural that parents
should be slow to encourage their
daughters in aspirations after any duties
and interests besides those of ministering
to their comfort and pleasure. In taking
for granted that this is the only object,
other than that of marriage, for which
women were created, they are but adopting
the received sentiment of society. No
doubt, too, they honestly believe that, in
keeping their daughters to themselves till
they marry, they are doing the best thing
for them, as well as pleasing themselves.
If the daughters take a different view,
parents think it is because they are young
and inexperienced, and incompetent to
judge. The fact is, it is the parents
who are inexperienced. Their youth was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
different in a hundred ways from the
youth of this generation; and the experience
of thirty years ago is far from
being infallible in dealing with the difficulties
and perplexities of the present.
No doubt young people are ignorant,
and want guidance. But they should be
helped and advised, not silenced. Parents
take upon themselves a heavy responsibility
when they hastily crush the longing
after a larger and more purposeful life.</p>

<p>That such an impulse is worthy of
respect can scarcely be denied. The
existence of capacities is in itself an indication
that they are intended for some
good purpose. Conscious power is not a
burden, to be borne with patience, but a
gift, for the due use of which the possessor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
rightly feels accountable. To have
a soul which can be satisfied with vanities
is not eminently virtuous and Christian,
but the reverse. To be awake to responsibilities,
sensitive in conscience, quickly
responsive to all kindling influences, is a
sign that education has, so far, done a
good work. A flowing river is no doubt
more troublesome to manage than a tranquil
pool; but pools, if let alone too long,
are apt to become noxious, as well as
useless. The current may require to be
wisely directed; but that there should
be a current of being, wanting to set
itself somewhere, is surely a cause for
thankful rejoicing. It is an unfortunate
misunderstanding of the true state
of the case that makes parents sigh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
over what might well be their happiness
and pride: one more exemplification of
the sluggishness which hates nothing so
bitterly as to be called upon to think—to
consider a new idea—perhaps to go farther,
and take a step out of the beaten track.
It is much easier, no doubt, to say to a
daughter who comes to you with her
original notions—‘My dear child, put it
out of your head directly; it cannot be
thought of for a moment’—than it would
be to hear her patiently, to consider how
far her crude ideas are practicable, to
help her, so far as may be, in carrying
them out. And one ought not to wonder
that the easiest course is the one most
commonly chosen. How far it may, or
may not, be the duty of daughters to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
sacrifice their own wishes to the temporary
pleasure of those to whom they
owe so much, is a separate question. It
is at least well for parents to know that,
far more than they are at all aware of,
it is felt to be a sacrifice, and that they
must accept it as such, if at all.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>
<p>The representation here given is, of
course, not universally applicable. It
is quite possible that in some senses, and
to some persons, an apparently empty
life may be easier, and even richer, than
one of toil. There are people to whom
the Happy Valley kind of life is by no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
means intolerable; and even earnest-minded
and conscientious girls, urged by
a strong sense of the heinousness of discontent,
often manage to crush troublesome
aspirations, and make themselves
happy. There is something undignified
in being miserable, without a just and
intelligible cause to show for it; and
many young women, capable of higher
things, accommodate themselves with a
considerable degree of cheerfulness to a
narrow and unsatisfying round of existence.
Nor is it intended to represent
ladies as habitually doing nothing. On
the contrary, they have many resources.
Among them are various arts and handicrafts,
gardening, letter-writing, and much
reading. Of these, the last is perhaps the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
most popular and the most delusive. A
girl who is ‘very fond of reading’ is
considered to be happily suited with
never-failing occupation, and no thought
is taken as to what is to come of her
reading. On this subject, the observations
of Miss Aikin, herself an experienced
reader, are worth considering. ‘Continual
reading,’ she says, ‘if desultory,
and without a definite object, favours indolence,
unsettles opinions, and of course
enfeebles the mental and moral energies.’
And Mr Robertson of Brighton, speaking
in reference to girls, remarks that they
‘read too much, and think too little. I
will answer for it that there are few girls
of eighteen who have not read more books
than I have.... That multifarious reading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
weakens the mind more than doing
nothing; for it becomes a necessity at
last, like smoking, and is an excuse for
the mind to lie dormant, whilst thought
is poured in, and runs through, a clear
stream, over unproductive gravel, on
which not even mosses grow. It is
the idlest of all idlenesses, and leaves
more of impotency than any other.’</p>

<p>The same might be said of all merely
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dilettante</i> occupation. Its fault is simply
that it <em>is dilettante</em>—literally a pastime.
It may as well be done, if nothing else
turns up, and that is all. And this drawback,
belonging to nearly all the ordinary
work of young women, they are by themselves
unable to overcome. Of course,
the case is partly in their own hands,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
and those who are by nature abnormally
energetic, will make a career for themselves
in spite of difficulties. Where the
inward impulse is irrepressible, it becomes
a lantern to the feet, and a lamp unto
the path, making the way of duty plain
and unmistakable. But for the few whose
course is thus illumined, there will be the
many hovering in uneasy doubt, their
consciences and intellects just lively
enough to make them restless and unhappy,
not sufficiently clear in their
minds as to right and wrong, either
to be nerved for vigorous action, or
to accept contentedly the conventional
duty of quiescence. There must be
something wrong in social regulations
which make a demand for exceptional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
wisdom and strength on the part of any
particular class; and that such a demand
is made upon average young women is
sufficiently clear. What society says to
them seems to be something to this effect.
Either you have force enough to win a
place in the world, in the face of heavy
discouragement, or you have not. If you
have, the discipline of the struggle is good
for you; if you have not, you are not
worth troubling about. Is not this a
hard thing to say to commonplace girls,
not professing to be better or stronger
than their neighbours? Why should
their task be made, by social and domestic
arrangements, peculiarly and needlessly
difficult? And why should it be
taken for granted that, if they fail, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
must be extraordinarily silly or self-indulgent?
More than any other class,
at the same age, they are exempted
from direction and control—liberally
gifted with the kind of freedom enjoyed
by the denizens of a village pound.
Within their prescribed sphere, they may
wander at will, and if they ‘there small
scope for action see,’ it is explained to
them that they must not ‘for this give
room to discontent;’ nor let their time
‘be spent in idly dreaming’ how they
might be</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">‘More free</span><br />
From outward hindrance or impediment.<br />
For presently this hindrance thou shalt find<br />
That without which all goodness were a task<br />
So slight, that virtue never could grow strong.’<br />
</p>

<p>In reply to such admonitions they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
tempted to inquire what task, other than
that of dreaming, is set before them—what
virtue, always excepting that one
virtue of passive submission, has any
chance of growing strong under such
conditions. The ‘slow,’ who sink into
dull inertia, and the ‘fast,’ who get rid
of their superfluous energy in silly extravagances,
have alike the excuse, that
at the moment when they need the support
of a routine explained and justified
by a reasonable purpose, discipline and
stimulus are at once withdrawn, leaving
in their place no external support beyond
the trivial demands and restraints of conventional
society.</p>

<p>It may seem that an exaggerated importance
is here attached to the interval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
between school and marriage; and if the
considerations brought forward had reference
to this period only, the charge
would be just. But rightly to estimate
the value of these years, we must bear in
mind that they are the spring-time of life—the
season of blossom, on which the
fruit of the future depends. It is then
that an impress is given to character
which lasts through life. Opportunities
then thrown away or misused can scarcely
be recovered in later years. And it has
seemed necessary to dwell upon the existing
tenour of young women’s lives, because,
in dealing with the question of
extending the duration of female education,
we must be largely influenced by
our conception of the alternative involved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
in leaving things as they are. It has
been said that the end of education is
‘to form a nation of living, orderly men.’
If it has been shown that the course now
pursued tends to make a large part of the
nation inanimate and disorderly, a case
would seem to be established for urging
efforts at improvement.</p>

to the uninitiated, that if mistresses are to do the
cooking, masters must dine alone. Dinners cannot
be cooked an hour beforehand, and left to serve themselves
up. In this, as in other arts, the finishing
touches are among the most important. This does
not mean, of course, that a mistress may not give
directions and occasional help, or that it may not be
a very good thing for girls to lend a hand, now and
then, by way of learning to cook. That is a different

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> ‘M. de Parthenau would have been surprised had
any one suggested that this peaceful life was less to
the taste of his children than himself. Like so many
excellent fathers, he sincerely believed that because
it suited him, it must suit them. He had forgotten
his own stormy youth, to find himself happy by his
fireside, and it never occurred to him to ask, “Is my
daughter happy?” So much the better, since he
could have done nothing; and Thérèse was the last
person to make him suspect that she was not perfectly
satisfied. Yet, whoever had seen her, would
have thought her destined for a wider sphere than that
of the narrow world where she strove to be content. It
had not always been so. Now, however, she stifled all
the aspirations, the radiant visions which once haunted
her, under the crowd of occupations which she found for herself. She silenced the cry of her intellect, and
yet heard it always; perhaps because she shunned as
snares the natural outlets which presented themselves,
refusing each rare opportunity of leaving home, lest
she should return discontented; and putting away
books and pencils, that she might have no interests
but those of her father and her poor dependents. It
was an honest, mistaken effort to do right; and the
confessor, who stood to her in the place of a conscience,
approved it—nay, urged it on her. It was
strange, this mute, ceaseless conflict, known only in
its full extent to herself, and hidden under so monotonous
and peaceful a life!’—<i>Sydonie’s Dowry</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 24.</p>

ceaseless conflict be hidden under many a monotonous

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Supposing</span> so much to be
granted, it will be asked, What
can be done? Clearly, girls
cannot be kept at school indefinitely till
they marry. When they leave school, say
at eighteen, what are they to do next?
The answer must chiefly depend on circumstances.
Where the resources of the
parents are such that there is a reasonable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
certainty of an abundant provision for the
future, an education corresponding with
that given by the universities to young
men—in other words, ‘the education of a
lady,’ considered irrespectively of any
specific uses to which it may afterwards
be turned—would appear to be the desideratum.
And clearly ‘the education of
a lady’ ought to mean the highest and the
finest culture of the time. The accurate
habits of thought and the intellectual polish
by which the scholar is distinguished,
ought to be no less carefully sought in
the training of women than in that of
men. This would be true, even if only for
the sake of the charm which high culture
gives to social intercourse, a charm attainable
in no other way. But apart from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
this consideration, the duties of women of
the higher class are such as to demand
varied knowledge as well as a disciplined
mind and character. Difficult cases in
social ethics frequently arise, on which
women are obliged to act and to guide the
action of others. However incompetent
they may be, they cannot escape the responsibility
of judging and deciding. And
though natural sagacity and the happy
impulses of which we hear so much often
come to their aid, prejudice and mistaken
impulses ought also to be taken into the
account as disturbing elements of a very
misleading kind. In dealing with social
difficulties, the value of a cultivated judgment,
able to unravel entangled evidence,
and to give due weight to a great variety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
of conflicting considerations, would seem
to be obvious enough. It would be well
worth while to exchange the wonderful
unconscious instinct, by which women are
supposed to leap to right conclusions, no
one knows how, for the conscious power of
looking steadily and comprehensively at
the whole facts of a case, and thereupon
shaping a course of action, with a clear
conception of its probable issues. Of
course, a merely literary education will
not give this power. Knowledge of the
world and of human nature, only to be
gained by observation and experience, go
farther than mere knowledge of books.
But the habit of impartiality and deliberation—of
surveying a wide field of thought—and
of penetrating, so far as human eye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
can see, into the heart of things—which is
promoted by genuine study even of books
alone—tends to produce an attitude of
mind favourable for the consideration of
complicated questions of any sort. A
comparison between the judgment of a
scholar and that of an uneducated man on
matters requiring delicate discrimination
and grasp of thought, shows the degree in
which the intellect may be fitted by training
for tasks of this nature. A large and
liberal culture is probably also the best
corrective of the tendency to take petty
views of things, and on this account is
especially to be desired for women on
whom it devolves to give the tone to
‘society.’</p>

<p>How far it may be desirable or justifiable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
for women to take part in political
affairs is a vexed question, into
which it is the less necessary here to
enter, inasmuch as it is evident that
the same kind of intellectual training
which forms the groundwork of the education
of a statesman is needed for other
purposes. Women who think at all can
scarcely help thinking about the condition
of the poor, and to arrive at sound conclusions
on so vast a subject involves an
acquaintance more or less complete with
almost every consideration which comes
within the range of the politician. Unpaid
work, such as the management of
hospitals, workhouses, prisons and reformatories,
and charitable societies, naturally
devolves upon the leisurely classes, and
offers a field in which cultivated women
may fitly labour. And the moment they
enter upon such work, or attempt in any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
way to alleviate the sufferings of the poor,
they find that a strong, clear head is as
necessary as a warm heart. The problem
how to deal with pauperism—the very
same difficulty which has hitherto baffled
the wisest of our statesmen—meets them
at the threshold of their works. The
encouragement or discouragement of the
pauper spirit depends in a great degree on
the discretion of district visitors and other
charitable agents; and the women who act
as the almoners of the rich and the advisers
of the poor need for their difficult task something
more than mere gushing benevolence.
Or to take national education. ‘My
Lords’ make codes, revise and re-revise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
them, and Members of Parliament exhaust
themselves in debates upon them; but a
large share of their practical working devolves
upon the wives and daughters of
the clergy, and other ladies. Similarly of
sanitary reform, which now attracts much
attention. Sanitary laws and regulations
have been enacted, and no doubt with
good effect, but boards of health and inspectors
can do but little without the
intelligent co-operation of the women, on
whom it depends to enforce personal and
household hygiene in every family. Many
other social questions might be mentioned on which
women are required to know and to act.
It would, in fact, be difficult to
point out any measure of domestic policy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
which has been brought before Parliament
during the last few years, on which it
is not as directly important that right
opinions should be formed by women as
by men.</p>

<p>The higher education already spoken of
would serve as a preparation for literary
work, and as a groundwork for more
definite technical instruction in every
department of art. And, lastly, an extended
course of study is, above all things,
necessary for those who are to undertake
the office of teaching others. The incompleteness
of the education of schoolmistresses
and governesses is a drawback
which no amount of intelligence and
goodwill can enable them entirely to
overcome. It is obvious that for those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
who have to impart knowledge the primary
requisite is to possess it; and it
is one of the great difficulties of female
teachers that they are called upon to
instruct others, while very inadequately
instructed themselves. The more earnest
and conscientious devote their leisure
hours to continued study, and, no doubt,
much may be done in this way; but it is
at the cost of overwork, often involving
the sacrifice of health, to say nothing of
the disadvantages of working alone, without
a teacher, often without good books,
and without the wholesome stimulus of
companionship.</p>

<p>These considerations lead up to the
more distinctly professional side of the
question, that which relates to the pursuit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
of any particular calling as a means
of maintenance. Every one knows that
there are women, some even of the upper
class, who must earn their own living;
and this being admitted, it will scarcely
be disputed that they ought to be put
into the best way of doing it. The thing
to find out seems to be what professions
are there, taking the word as including
business of all sorts, to which they might
betake themselves with a fair prospect of
success? Perhaps we may gain some light
by looking into history, and seeing what
went on in earlier times, before the advance
of science, with its infinite subdivisions
of labour, had made it almost
impossible to carry on any profitable
pursuit within the precincts of home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>Confining ourselves, for the sake of
brevity, to English history, we find among
the ordinary avocations of women Medicine
and Surgery, including the compounding
and dispensing of drugs; the service
of the afflicted and distressed in mind,
body, or estate; farming; marketing; and
a variety of domestic manufactures, too
numerous to recite in detail.</p>

<p>Would the same pursuits, under regulations
adapted to altered conditions, be
proper for women now? Among those
which have been mentioned, that of Medicine
appears peculiarly desirable, as
affording scope for the exercise of the
highest gifts, in a field in which women’s
close acquaintance with the details of
domestic life would be a valuable adjunct.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
The medical profession is now accessible
to any competent woman who is able to
defray the cost of instruction. The licence
of the Court of Apothecaries, which constitutes
a legal qualification for general
practice, is given on passing the required
examinations. There is no difficulty in
the way of apprenticeship, and lectures
and hospital practice are attainable, though
at a higher cost to individual students,
than would be incurred if the expense
were divided among several. The objection
often urged against the practice of
medicine by women, that they have no
confidence in each other, and that a medical
woman would therefore find herself
without patients, can only be conclusively
answered by facts. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">À priori</i>, there is some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
reason to believe, that, always assuming
the education to be equally thorough and
equally well attested, the services of a
lady will be preferred; but till women
have full opportunity of choice, it is impossible
to say positively what they will
choose. The experience of a few years
will decide. In the meantime, Miss Garrett’s
very remarkable success is at least
encouraging to other aspirants in the same
field.</p>

<p>Closely allied to the practice of medicine
are the functions of educated women
in ministering to the poor, the insane, and
the criminal. These services, so far as
they are paid, are now chiefly carried on
in workhouses, hospitals, reformatories,
and penitentiaries. The superintendence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
of nurses and the offices of matron and
schoolmistress are in the hands of women,
and there seems room for further development
in this direction. It may be a question
for consideration whether in some
cases it might not be desirable to substitute
the services of an educated Christian
lady for those of the chaplain. The duties
of a workhouse chaplain are thus defined
by the Poor-Law Board:—</p>


<p>‘<span class="smcap">Art. 211.</span> <i>Duties of the Chaplain.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The following shall be the duties of
the chaplain:—</p>

<p>‘No. 1. To read prayers, and preach a
sermon to the paupers and other inmates
of the workhouse on every Sunday, and
on Good Friday and Christmas-day, unless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
the guardians, with the consent of the
commissioners, may otherwise direct.</p>

<p>‘No. 2. To examine the children, and
to catechise such as belong to the Church
of England, at least once in every month,
and to make a record of the same, and
state the dates of his attendance, the
general progress and condition of the children,
and the moral and religious state of
the inmates generally, in a book to be kept
for that purpose, to be laid before the
guardians at their next ordinary meeting,
and to be termed “The Chaplain’s Report.”</p>

<p>‘No. 3. To visit the sick paupers, and to
administer religious consolation to them in
the workhouse, at such periods as the guardians
may appoint, and when applied to
for that purpose by the master or matron.’</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>The work laid out under the two last
clauses might certainly be done as well, in
some respects perhaps better, by a duly
qualified lady; and on the face of it, there
seems to be no particular reason why
paupers should not attend their parish
church and be visited by the clergyman
like other parishioners. The desirableness
of workhouse visiting by ladies has been
much discussed, and is now beginning to
be acknowledged. The presence of a lady
in an official capacity might be still more
valuable, both as being permanent and as
waiving the difficulties which are so apt to
come in the way of philanthropic interference
in state institutions. A lady
appointed expressly by the guardians
themselves could scarcely provoke jealousy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
and her representations, based on
thorough knowledge of the matter in hand,
and modified by sympathy with the difficulties
and scruples of authorities, as well
as with the claims of the suffering, would
be comparatively exempt from the charge
of officiousness. That she would naturally
gather round her such helpers as she
might need in an unofficial capacity is an
obvious advantage. The same observations
would seem to be applicable to hospitals
and prisons, and all public institutions
where women are employed in a subordinate
capacity. That the presence and the
active influence of a lady, by whatever
name she might be called, would be a
valuable element, wherever the sick in
mind or body are congregated together, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
generally admitted, though the theory has
not in England been acted upon to any
considerable extent.</p>

<p>Next in our enumeration comes the
business of farming. The social prejudice
against useful occupations of any sort, as
distinguished from those which are supposed
to be ornamental, has here been
actively at work. The superintendence
of farming operations is still, however,
largely shared by women, especially in the
north of England. In commercial dealings
there is a good deal of work to be
done which could not, at any rate in our
present very imperfect state of civilisation,
be properly undertaken by women. There
are, however, branches of mercantile and
quasi-mercantile business, including that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
profession of modern growth which has
been called ‘management,’—in which wise
arrangements, carefully made, are all that
is required to make them suitable. In
almost every kind of business, wholesale
and retail, the book-keeping and the correspondence
might be very fitly carried
on by competent women.</p>

<p>With regard to the manufactures which
now form so vast a portion of our national
industry, a great revolution has
taken place, and it is here, above all, that
a re-adjustment of social and domestic
arrangements, involving some innovation
on conventional ideas and usages, seems
to be imperatively needed. Down to a
comparatively recent period, every household
was a workshop. It is within the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
present generation that the sewing-machine
has laid hold of the last remaining
implement of domestic manufacture. The
home is no longer a manufactory. Spinning,
weaving, knitting, sewing, all are
gone, or going. What has become of the
busy hands and brains? The hands are
gone into factories, the brains are idle.
We cannot call back the hands, and again
set them to work in the domestic manufactory.
Might it not be possible to bring
them again under womanly influence, and
at the same time find fit work for the
brains, by introducing women of the employing
class into factories? Might we
not restore the old order of things, under
which the payers of wages and the receivers
of wages worked together, to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
mutual advantage of both—by replacing
women in the position of directors and
overlookers of female labour? It is vain
to say that a factory is not a fit place for
a lady. If it is not, it ought to be made
so. If the moral atmosphere of a workshop
is necessarily debasing, no human
being ought to be exposed to its influence.
But is it <em>necessarily</em> debasing? Are machines
in themselves demoralising? What
is the moral difference between a spinning-jenny
and a distaff? Are knitting-needles
refined, and knitting-machines
coarse? Is there any reason, in the
nature of things, why the moral tone of
a factory should be less pure and elevating
than that of the home? Is it not
rather that we want, in our modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
workshops, the influence conveyed by
daily intercourse between women to
whom wealth has given the means of
culture and refinement, and the labourers
whom poverty obliges to work with their
hands, but who need not therefore part
with any essential feminine attribute?
If, in all the works where women are
employed in the inferior departments, the
daughters of the masters were instructed
in the business, made so thoroughly conversant
with it as to be able to take a
real part in its direction, two advantages
would be gained. The higher class of
workers would acquire larger sympathies,
more living interests, increased aptitude
for affairs, and an exhilarating sense of
usefulness—of having a place in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
world from which they would be missed
if they were withdrawn from it. The
lower class would, on their part, be
elevated by the contact with a genuine
refinement, not too ‘fine’ to be useful.
They would see that a lady is a lady, not
in virtue of her costly dress and luxurious
habits, but in the gentleness, the truthfulness,
and the sensitive sympathy, which
are among the most precious fruits of
high culture. And it can scarcely be
doubted that such an example, such an
ideal, brought within the immediate and
daily contemplation of women and girls
of the labouring class, would be more
effectual in rectifying their standard of
morals and refinement than any philanthropic
agency, however well-intentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
and judicious, which could be brought to
bear from without. In some cases there
might be difficulties in the way of teaching
women the practical parts of a manufacture,
but there can be few businesses
in which some place might not be found
for them. Even where female labourers
are not employed in the lower departments—though
there the case is the
strongest—women might often take part
in the direction, with great advantage to
themselves, and at least without injury to
any one else.</p>

<p>It appears, then, that a transference of
the scene of action, and an accommodation
of old principles and practices to
new circumstances, is the task of the present
generation, and the true answer to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
the appeal of women for something to do.
The change proposed, so far from being a
departure from the old ways, is, in fact,
a recurrence to them. The advocates of
things as they are, are the innovators.
Those who sigh after things as they might
be, are the old-fashioned people, eager to
retain, with only such modifications as
advancing civilisation has made indispensable,
all that is best in things as they
were.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">An</span> obvious rejoinder to the foregoing
suggestions will at once
present itself. It will be said
that professions and business may be all
very well—may indeed be best—for single
women, but that sooner or later the great
majority marry, and any plan of life
which fails to recognise this contingency
is unpractical and absurd. This is most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
true. We have to deal with facts; and
it is a most important, though not the
sole question, How would a higher education
and professional training act upon
family life? Home duties fall to the
lot of almost every woman, and nothing
which tends to incapacitate for the performance
of them ought to be encouraged.
Let us ask, then, what are the home
duties of women as such, and what are
the qualifications required for their discharge?
And here we must remember
that the claims involved in the conjugal
and parental and filial relations are not
special to women. They are not, indeed,
to be disregarded in considering the bearing
of a scheme of education; but in the
discussion of the home duties of women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
<em>as such</em>, it is convenient to treat separately
those which are not shared by men.</p>

<p>If we bring before our mind’s eye the
picture of an English home, we see that
the household work is divided between
the mistress and the servants. Where
there are grown-up daughters, they sometimes
help the mistress in her work, or
the servants in theirs, but they have no
distinct functions of their own. It appears,
then, that in an inquiry relating to
the upper and middle classes, the only
home duties special to women which can
come under review, are those of the mistress
of the household. What are her
functions? Those of government and
administration. All housekeepers will
agree that this is the work they have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
do, though they may not be accustomed
to call it by these names. The inexperienced
mistress complains, not that she
does not know how to cook, or to sew,
or to keep the furniture in order—these
arts, if she wants them, can be quickly
acquired; her perplexity is how to manage
the servants. To draw the line between
necessary subordination and vexatious
interference—to apportion to each
a fair share of work, and to see that the
work is done—to be liberal and considerate
without over-indulgence,—these are
duties requiring judgment, moderation,
method, decision, often no small share of
moral courage; in other words, precisely
the same qualities which are wanted in
governing bodies of workpeople. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
administration also, it is obvious that,
though on a different scale, the same
sagacity, prudence, and foresight which
would make a woman successful in business,
would conduce to the economical
management of domestic concerns.</p>

<p>The head of a household wants an ideal
to work up to, and the governing and
administrative power which will enable
her to carry out her idea. Here, as elsewhere,
motive is the primary requisite.
A woman to whom huggermugger is intolerable
will find means of escaping from
it—if necessary, by the labour of her own
hands—more often, perhaps, by the skilful
direction of the labour of others. But
one who has no inner sense of the beauty
of order, to whom the rhythmic flow of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
well-governed household is an unmeaning
conception, or who lacks the gift of mastery
over details, may be cooking and
sewing and looking after things from
morning till night; she may be anxiously
obedient to conventional regulations, rigid
in the observance of ceremonies unmeaning
in themselves or unsuited to her position;
with all her striving, she will never
realise the vision of an ideal English
home.</p>

<p>It appears, then, that first, imagination,
combined with a certain sensitiveness
of refinement, and secondly, the faculty
of government and administration, are
the qualifications chiefly necessary for
the performance of home duties. No
education can be relied upon as infallibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
securing these rare gifts; but it may be
assumed that extensive reading of the
best books tends to cultivate imagination
and refinement, and that a life of active
exertion tends to bring out the qualities
which go to make up the governing and
administrative faculty; and if so, a liberal
education and the pursuit of a profession
are perhaps, on the whole, the best training
that the conditions of modern society
can supply for the special functions of
the mistress of a household.</p>

<p>It will, however, be pointed out by
practical people, that even supposing the
training to be good as regards domestic
life, parents will not throw away their
money on a costly preparation for a profession
which is most likely to be abandoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
in a few years; and again, that the
contingency of marriage is likely to act as
a discouragement to girls, making them
so languid in endeavour, that they would
have small chance of success in a professional
career.</p>

<p>To the last objection experience would
not lead us to attach much weight. But
supposing that, either through want of
energy or perseverance, or from any other
deficiency, women should take a low place
in the professional ranks, what then?
The object of their education would have
been, not to set them on a pinnacle of
distinction, but to make them useful
labourers; and if this end were attained,
society, at any rate, would have no reason
to complain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>It is true, however, that fathers are
likely to hesitate in spending money on
what may seem a doubtful speculation as
regards pecuniary returns. And if marriage
necessarily involves the complete
abandonment of a profession, the chances
are somewhat against professional education
as an investment of capital, though
perhaps less so than would at first sight
appear. Of course much depends on the
amount of money which it is necessary to
expend. To take the medical profession,
as being, among those which women are
likely to enter, the one in which the cost
of training is probably the highest—it is
a liberal computation to allow £500 as
covering the cost of instruction over and
above the personal expenses, which would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
be going on all the same whether a girl
were being educated or not. Such a sum
would, in three or four years of successful
practice, be recovered, and any further
earnings would be clear gain. No doubt,
in cases of very early marriage, a part or
even the whole of the sum expended would
be sunk; and the result of giving women
professions would probably be, on the
whole, to encourage comparatively early
marriage, partly by bringing persons of
congenial tastes into mutual intercourse,
and partly by rendering marriages possible
which would otherwise be flagrantly imprudent.
But supposing that a woman
married a rich man before she had begun
to practise, the loss of the sum mentioned
could easily be spared. If she married a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
poor man, or a man dependent on an
uncertain income, the sacrifice might be
regarded in the light of a sum paid for
insurance—the provision of a resource in
case of widowhood or other misfortune,
which it is well to have in reserve, though
it may be still better never to want it.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, does marriage
necessarily involve giving up a profession?
On the face of it, judging by
existing facts, one would incline to the
contrary view. Some of the highest
names in literature and art are those of
married women; many schoolmistresses
are married; clergymen’s wives notoriously
undertake a large share of extra-domestic
work; and there is no evidence
that in any of these cases the husbands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
are neglected, or the children worse
brought up than other people’s. It seems
to be forgotten that women have always
been married. Marriage is not a modern
discovery, offering a hitherto untrodden
field of action for feminine energy.
The novelty is, that, as has been
said already, the old field has been invaded
and taken possession of by machinery.
The married ladies of former days, instead
of sitting in drawing-rooms, eating the
bread of idleness, got through a vast
amount of household business, which their
successors cannot possibly do, simply because
it is not there to be done. An educated
woman, of active, methodical habits,
blessed with good servants, as good mistresses
generally are, finds an hour a day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
amply sufficient for her housekeeping.
Nothing is gained by spreading it out
over a longer time.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Allowing a fair
margin for what are technically called
‘social’ claims, there remains a surplus,
of course varying very considerably in
extent, according to circumstances. The
question then arises, whether a married
woman, having time and energy to spare,
may or may not legitimately spend it, if
she likes, either in definitely professional
work, or in the unpaid public services,
which, when seriously undertaken, constitute
something nearly equivalent to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
profession. Inasmuch as the adoption of
such a course would most probably effect
some change in the aspect of family life,
it is reasonable to ask whether such change
is likely to be for good or for evil; and
any objections which may suggest themselves
ought to be respectfully considered.</p>

<p>One of the most obvious is the fear
that a profession might prove a snare,
leading to the neglect of humbler and
more irksome duties. And it is right to
admit frankly that the apprehension may
not be altogether groundless. M. Simon,
indeed, asserts, with the happy confidence
we are all so apt to display on matters
of which we have had no experience, that
household drudgery, ‘though very laborious,
is agreeable to women;’ and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
Sydney Smith has made merry over the
notion that a mother would desert an
infant for a quadratic equation. And of
course, put in that extreme way, the idea
is ridiculous. But looking at the case
broadly—putting on one side the little
fretting cares and worries of domestic
life, and on the other the larger and more
genial interests of professional work, it
may be confessed that a temptation might
very possibly arise to shirk the less engaging
task. But it does not follow that
because a temptation exists, it must be
irresistible. To construct a plan of life
absolutely free from temptation is a
simple impossibility, even supposing it to
be desirable. Every career has its snares,
and a life of narrow interests and responsibilities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
is no exception to the rule. The
true safeguard seems to consist, not in
restraints and limitations, but in a vivid
sense of all that is involved in the closer
relationships, and in a steadfast habit of
submission to duty. In the present case
it may be noted that, however fascinating
the temptation may be, it is at any rate
open and well understood. It is not a
pitfall, which any one could walk into
unawares through ignorance of its existence.
The paramount importance of home
duties is enforced by all the sanctions of
an overwhelming public opinion. Any
neglect is liable to be punished, not only
by the immediate discomfort arising from
it, but by universal disapproval. An
offence against which the warnings are so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
trumpet-tongued, and of which the consequences
are so thoroughly disagreeable,
can scarcely be very dangerously attractive.</p>

<p>If it is admitted that professional
women are likely, or at least as likely as
others, to be both able and diligent in the
discharge of family obligations, another
objection may be raised, founded on the
apprehension that a similarity of pursuits
would produce an unpleasant similarity
between men and women. One of the
most plausible arguments in behalf of dissimilar
education is that which rests on
the general desirableness of variety. We
do not want to be all alike. The course
of civilisation tends, it is said, already too
strongly towards uniformity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p class="poetry">
‘For “ground in yonder social mill,<br />
We rub each other’s angles down,<br />
And lose,” he said, “in form and gloss<br />
The picturesque of man and man.”’<br />
</p>

<p>And if it could be shown that the isolation
of the sexes produces variety of the
best kind, and to the greatest possible
extent, it would no doubt be a strong
argument in its favour. But it is questionable
whether this is the best means of
obtaining variety. As there can be no
unanimity on matters of which one party
is ignorant, so also, in the same sense,
there can be no diversity. We do not
obtain two views of a subject by incapacitating
one of the parties from taking any
view at all. If the differences between
men and women are such that they are
predisposed to treat whatever comes before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
them in a somewhat different manner,
we shall get greater variety by presenting
to both the most important subjects of
thought, than by sorting out subjects into
classes and submitting each to a kind of
class treatment. And so also as to methods
of training. It seems likely that a
more healthily diversified type of character
will be obtained by cultivating the common
human element, and leaving individual
differences free to develop themselves,
than by dividing mankind into two great
sections and forcing each into a mould.
You may indeed obtain diversity by mutilation
or distortion. You may make a
girl unlike a boy by shutting her up,
giving her insufficient air and exercise,
and teaching her that grace and refinement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
are synonymous with affectation and
feebleness. You may make a boy unlike
a girl by teaching him to care for nothing
but out-of-door sports, and by making him
believe that he is showing spirit when he
is rude and selfish. But this is not the
kind of variety that any one seriously
wishes to cultivate.</p>

<p>It may here perhaps be argued on the
other hand, that to give wives professions
would tend to separate them from their
husbands by throwing them into a society
of their own, and leading them to set up
a distinct set of independent interests,—that
whereas a wife now throws herself
into her husband’s concerns, losing sight
of herself in her sympathy with him, she
would, if she had a pursuit of her own, be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
led astray by ambition, occupied with her
own aims, absorbed in a current of life
apart from his. Here again it may be
admitted that the danger might, in very
rare cases, possibly exist. But, on the
whole, the risk seems to be much more
than counterbalanced by a very strong
tendency in an exactly opposite direction.
In many cases, the profession of both
would be the same, judging by present
experience. Artists marry artists, clergymen’s
daughters marry clergymen, literary
women often, though not always, marry
literary men, medical women would probably
marry medical men, and so on. It is
likely that a man who chose to marry a
professional woman at all would marry
in his own profession. But supposing it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
were otherwise, a woman who had work
similar, though not in all respects identical
with that of her husband, would be more
able than one whose occupation was of an
entirely alien character, to sympathise
with him in his difficulties and in his successes.
She would understand them and
enter into them with a first-hand kind of
interest, fuller and more intelligent, if not
more genuine, than a merely reflected
interest could be. On the other hand, it
would be at least as easy for a husband to
enter into interests somewhat akin to his
own, as into the small domestic worries
which fill so large a space in the thoughts
and imaginations of women who have
nothing else to occupy them. There are
many wives who really have very little to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
talk to their husbands about, except the
virtues or the crimes of servants, and the
little gossip of the neighbourhood. If
their husbands will not listen to what they
have to say on these subjects, they are
obliged to take refuge in silence.</p>

<p>The enormous loss to general culture
entailed by the solitude of the male intellect
is very little thought of. Yet it
would seem obvious enough that children
brought up in a home where the everyday
conversation is of a somewhat thoughtful
and literary cast, have an immense start
as compared with those who learn nothing
unconsciously, and are obliged to gather
all their knowledge laboriously from books.
Social and domestic intercourse is an
educational instrument largely used in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
cultivated circles. In the great mass of
English society it is scarcely used at all,
for this obvious reason, that education is
in great part onesided, and the easy interchange
of thought is therefore impossible.
A slight infusion of an intellectual element
would go far to expel the gossip and the
microscopic criticism of one’s neighbours,
which forms so large and so degrading a
part in the domestic talk of the middle
classes. The mental effort need not be a
severe one. Talk may be very small, and
yet have a certain dignity, if it touches
even but lightly on elevating subjects. It
is the effort to draw up conversation from
empty wells that wearies the spirit, and
drives even goodnatured people into
scandal and slander. Contrast the forced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
and insipid small talk of ordinary society,
resorted to by way of recreation, but in
the last degree unrefreshing in its nature,
with the spontaneous overflowings of a
cultivated mind.</p>

<p class="poetry">
‘She spake such good thoughts natural, as if she always thought them—<br />
She had sympathies so rapid, open, free as bird on branch,<br />
Just as ready to fly east as west, whichever way besought them,<br />
In the birchen wood a chirrup, or a cock-crow in the grange.<br />
In her utmost lightness there is truth—and often she speaks lightly,<br />
Has a grace in being gay, which even mournful souls approve;<br />
For the root of some grave earnest thought is under-struck so rightly,<br />
As to justify the foliage and the waving flowers above.’<br />
</p>

<p>It is in fact as a means of bringing men
and women together, and bridging over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
the intellectual gulf between them, that a
more liberal education and a larger scope
for women are chiefly to be desired. It
has been pointed out by a well-known
essayist, that ‘the purpose of education is
not always to foster natural gifts, but
sometimes to bring out faculties that
might otherwise remain dormant; and
especially so far as to make the persons
educated cognisant of excellence in those
faculties in others.’ And even supposing
it could be proved that the separate systems
are eminently successful in developing
certain peculiarly masculine or feminine
gifts, the result would be dearly purchased
by the sacrifice of mutual understanding
and appreciation.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, it is often assumed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
the only way of getting husbands and
wives to agree is to keep them well apart.
Common ground, it is taken for granted,
must of course be a battle ground. If the
theory of the peculiarly receptive character
of the female intellect has any truth in it,
it might be expected to be rather the
other way, and that wives would, as a rule,
be only too ready to adopt their husbands’
opinions. In any case, contact has an
undoubted tendency to produce unanimity,
and the chances are therefore in
favour of agreement. And that there
should be intelligent agreement, a community
of thought and feeling, on all
matters of importance, is surely the first
necessity for the healthy and harmonious
development of family life. M. Simon has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
drawn a vivid picture of the influence on
children of discordance between fathers
and mothers, even when there is nothing
like an open rupture.</p>

<p>The author of ‘Vincenzo’ has given in
that remarkable story a view too painfully
lifelike to be disbelieved, of the conjugal
misery resulting from a profound dissonance
between a husband and wife on religious
and political questions, and asserts
that the wreck of domestic happiness so
graphically pictured represents a reality
far from uncommon. ‘Would to God,’
he exclaims, ‘that the case were an isolated
one! But no; there is scarcely any
corner in Italy, scarcely any corner in
Europe, that does not exhibit plenty of
such and worse.’ Such a state of things
could scarcely exist in England. The
counteracting influences are too many and
too strong. But it cannot be said that we
are exempt from danger. In how many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
English families wives and sisters are
clinging blindly to traditional beliefs and
observances, from which husbands and
brothers are turning away with indifference
or dislike. How natural the transition
from the theory which assigns ‘to
the one the supremacy of the head, to the
other that of the heart’—to that further
division which attributes to the one Reason,
to the other Faith. Heartless Rationalism
and imbecile credulity! Is it in the
union of these feeble and jarring tones
that we shall find the full chord of family
harmony? Ought we not rather to turn
with suspicion from these artificial attempts
to apportion attributes and duties?
May we not welcome, as at least a step in
the right direction, a change in our conventional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
habits, which may extend,
though in ever so small a degree, the region
of common thoughts and aims, common

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">If</span> it be admitted that the law
of human duty is the same
for both sexes, and if the
specific functions belonging to each demand
substantially the same qualities
for their performance, it appears to follow
that the education required is likely to
be, in its broader and more essential
features, the same. What that education<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
ought to be has lately been much discussed,
but at present without much sign
of approaching unanimity. That there
should be great difference of opinion is
natural, inasmuch as almost every one
is inclined to recommend for universal
adoption just what he happens to like
best himself; while, on the other hand,
a few people of a different turn of mind
are disposed to undervalue what they
possess themselves, and to give extra
credit to subjects or methods, the insufficiency
of which has not been brought
home to them by personal experience.
In the education of girls the selection
of subjects seems to be directed by no
principle whatever. Strong protests are
raised against assimilating it to that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
boys; but very little is said as to the
particulars in which it ought to differ.
The present distribution is, indeed, somewhat
whimsical. Inasmuch as young
men go into offices where they have to
conduct foreign correspondence, and, as
they travel about all over the world,
they are taught the dead languages. As
woman’s place is the domestic hearth,
and as middle class women rarely see a
foreigner, they are taught modern languages
with a special view to facility in
speaking. As men are supposed to work
with their heads all day, and have nothing
in the world to do when they are
indisposed for reading but to smoke or to
go to sleep, they are taught neither music
nor drawing. As women have always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
the resource of needlework, they learn
music and drawing besides. As women
are not expected to take part in political
affairs, they are taught history. As men
do, boys learn mathematics instead. In
physical science, astronomy and botany
are considered the ladies’ department.
Chemistry and mechanics being the
branches most directly applicable to domestic
uses, are reserved for boys.</p>

<p>These distinctions ought rather, however,
to be spoken of as a thing of the
past. The educators of boys and girls
respectively are learning and borrowing
from each other.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> An approximation is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
already in progress, in which the encroachment,
if it be an encroachment,
is chiefly from the side of boys; for
while Latin and mathematics are slowly
making their way into girls’ schools, we
find that in the University local examinations,
music, drawing, and modern
languages have from the beginning been
recognised as desirable for boys. It is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
like most other things, very much a
question of degree. The system of mutual
isolation has never been thoroughly
carried out. Even those who hold most
strongly that classics and mathematics
are proper for boys, and modern languages
and the fine arts for girls, leave
as common ground the wide field of
English literature, in itself almost an
education. To a large extent men and
women read the same books, magazines,
and newspapers; and though in the
highest class of literature, written by
scholars for scholars, and, therefore, full
of classical and scientific allusions, there
is much that women only half understand,
the deficiency under which they
labour is shared by many male readers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>
<p>Probably, after all, it matters less what
is nominally taught, than that, whatever
it is, it should be taught in the best way.
Any subject may be made flat and unprofitable
if unintelligently taught; and, on
the other hand, there is scarcely anything
which may not be made an instrument
of intellectual discipline, if wisely used.
Then, again, all branches of knowledge
are so closely connected and mutually
dependent, that it is scarcely possible to
learn anything which will not be found
more or less useful hereafter in learning
something else. Even the much despised
and denounced ‘smattering of many
things,’ has its merits in this way, as well
as in giving a certain breadth of vision,
by opening vistas into innumerable fields<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
of knowledge, never to be explored by
any single human being. The degree in
which the study of certain subjects cultivates
certain faculties is a matter on
which we are far from agreeing. Nor
is it decided—in fact we have scarcely
begun to discuss—what faculties most
need cultivation. In the middle classes
the imagination seems to be the one in
which the deficiency is most marked.
Every now and then some one recommends
mathematics for girls as a curb to
the imagination. It might be as well
first to ascertain whether the imaginations
of commonplace girls want to be
curbed; whether, on the contrary, they
do not want rather to be awakened and
set to work, with something to work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
upon. The business of the imagination
is not merely to build castles in the air,
though that is, no doubt, a useful and
commendable exercise; it has other and
most important duties to perform. For,
manifestly, an unimaginative person is
destitute of one of the main elements of
sympathy. Probably, if the truth were
known, it would be found that injustice
and unkindness are comparatively seldom
caused by harshness of disposition. They
are the result of an incapacity for imagining
ourselves to be somebody else. Any
one who has tried it must be aware of
the enormous difficulty of conceiving the
state of mind of a pauper or a thief.
The same difficulty is experienced in a
degree by any one in easy circumstances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
in realising the condition and looking
from the point of view of a very poor,
or comparatively poor person. It is
probably equally difficult to ordinary
minds to imagine the condition of always
having more money than you quite know
what to do with. The absence of sympathy
between youth and age is traceable
to the same want. Old people have either
forgotten their own youth, or they remember
it too well, and fall into the not
less fatal mistake of supposing that the
new youth is like their own. Young
people, on their part, are equally at a loss
to understand what it is to be old. In
all the relations of life, the want of imagination
produces defective sympathy, and
defective sympathy brings in its train all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
sorts of vague and intolerable evils. In
every branch of study a vivid imagination
is a most powerful agent, aiding the
memory, and bringing clearly before the
mind the materials on which a judgment
has to be formed.</p>

<p>This, however, is not the place to discuss
the comparative importance of the
mental faculties. Without going into
the details of what, or how to teach, it
will be more to the purpose to inquire
whether there are any general measures,
the working of which is likely to be
beneficial, let the subjects and the methods
of instruction be what they may.</p>

<p>Among the most necessary, and the
most easily and immediately applicable,
is the extension to women of such examinations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
as demand a high standard of
attainment. The test of a searching examination
is indispensable as a guarantee
for the qualifications of teachers; it is
wanted as a stimulus by young women
studying with no immediate object in
view, and no incentive to exertion other
than the high, but dim and distant, purpose
of self-culture. This purpose, regarded
in its bearing on the general
welfare, is indeed honourable and animating,
and every other must be subordinate
to it. But we must not forget that we
have to deal with human and very imperfect
beings; and it is not difficult to
believe that young women of only average
energy and perseverance, while working
in the main towards the higher end, may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
yet need an occasionally recurring stage
within sight, as an allurement to draw
them on, and to help them in their
struggle with the temptations to indolence
which lie thick about their path. The
fact of having an examination to work
for, would not only be a stimulus to
themselves, it would also serve as a
defence against idle companions, whose
solicitations it is hard to refuse on the
mere ground of an abstract love of
learning.</p>

<p>The want of examinations for women
is not a new discovery. So long ago as
1841, Dr Arnold wrote to Mr Justice
Coleridge:—‘I feel quite as strongly as
you do the extreme difficulty of giving
to girls what really deserves the name of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
education intellectually. When —— was
young, I used to teach her some Latin
with her brothers, and that has been, I
think, of real use to her, and she feels it
now in reading and translating German,
of which she does a great deal. But
there is nothing for girls like the Degree
examination, which concentrates one’s
reading so beautifully, and makes one
master a certain number of books perfectly.
And unless we had a domestic
examination for young ladies, to be passed
before they come out, and another, like
the great go, before they come of age, I
do not see how the thing can ever be
effected. Seriously, I do not see how we
can supply sufficient encouragement for
systematic and laborious reading, or how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
we can insure many things being retained
at once fully in the mind, when we are
wholly without the machinery which we
have for our boys.’</p>

<p>In another letter, speaking of the need
of continual questioning in the case of a
boy, he says, ‘He wants this, and he
wants it daily, not only to interest and
excite him, but to dispel what is very apt
to grow around a lonely reader not constantly
questioned—a haze of indistinctness
as to a consciousness of his own
knowledge or ignorance; he takes a vague
impression for a definite one, an imperfect
notion for one that is full and complete,
and in this way he is continually deceiving
himself.’</p>

<p>This is an exact description of the state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
of the young female mind, even where
there has been considerable cultivation.
Women have ‘general ideas,’ which interest
and occupy their minds, but produce
little fruit, owing to their incompleteness
and uncertainty. Of course, it would be
absurd to recommend examinations as an
infallible cure for this or any other mental
defect. The familiar objections, that there
are many things which no examination can
test; that they sometimes encourage cram
and check originality; and that, when
abused, they foster ambition, and cause
overexcitement and overwork—no doubt
have some truth in them. But the question
is whether, on the whole, examinations
work for good or for evil; and the testimony
of long experience seems to be strongly in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
their favour. To refuse to test knowledge,
because you cannot by the same process
judge of moral excellence, is about as wise
as to say that a man ought not to eat, because,
unless he also takes exercise, he will
not be in good health. Cram is no doubt
a very bad thing, but it is not a necessary
antecedent of examinations; and,
after all, there are alternatives worse than
cramming. It may be better even to
cram than to leave the mind quite empty;
and though the word has become, by perpetual
reiteration, closely associated with
the idea of examinations, it is as well to
remember that it is quite possible for
knowledge to be equally undigested, whether
it has been got up for an examination
or not. As to fostering ambition, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
question seems to be, whether it is possible,
or even desirable, entirely to eradicate
it, and whether to direct it towards
a respectable object, the pursuit of which
at least implies some good moral qualities,
may not be useful as diverting it from
that meanest of aims—the only one held
up indiscriminately to women of every
grade—that of shining in society. The
danger of injury to health, through excitement
and overwork, is within the
control of parents and teachers. As regards
girls, the experience of the Cambridge
local examinations has proved
beyond a doubt that, where ordinary common
sense is practised, there is no risk
whatever of this sort.</p>

<p>There are at present no examinations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
open to women of such standing as to
constitute a fitting test of advanced
scholarship. The examinations of the
Society of Arts, being primarily intended
for artisans, are manifestly inadequate;
and the University local examinations
are limited to students under eighteen.
The University of London, having adopted
the principle of making its examinations
simply a test and standard of acquirement,
without enforcing upon students
that their knowledge should have been
acquired by attendance at college lectures,
or under any particular system, is in a
peculiarly favourable position for giving
assistance in this matter. The extension
of the London examinations to women
need present no greater difficulties than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
those which have been already overcome
in throwing open the Cambridge local
examinations to girls, and would go far
towards supplying a want which every
day becomes more pressing.</p>

<p>The access to progressive examinations,
of such a character as to test and attest
advanced attainments, would, there is
every reason to believe, at once begin to
work in lengthening the period of study.
It would probably tell first upon the
ladies’ colleges; but its influence would
not be limited to college students. Where
circumstances make it inconvenient for a
girl to attend classes, it may still be
practicable for her to pursue her studies
at home, so long as there is some definite
and intelligible object in view. An essential<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
requisite is the use of a room where
she can be secure from trivial interruptions.
This might seem obvious enough;
but those who know anything of family
life in the middle class are aware that it
is a privilege rarely accorded to young
women. The best teaching within reach
would, of course, be a great assistance,
but would not be in all cases indispensable.</p>

<p>An increase in the number of colleges
and a higher standard of efficiency would
be the natural result of retaining the
students under instruction for a longer
time, and this again would improve the
quality of teachers. Probably something
more would still be required in the way
of training for teachers. It seems to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
the opinion of the persons best qualified
to judge, that some technical instruction
is required as a preparation for teaching,
and that such instruction might be obtained
by taking a short course at a
training-college at the end of a general
education.</p>

<p>The ladies’ colleges may fairly be expected
to supply ‘the education of a
lady.’ The special training for any particular
profession must be obtained in
distinct schools. This, of course, applies
to every branch of art. It applies also to
the study of medicine. There is at present
no medical school for women; and
individual students are therefore obliged
to obtain the necessary instruction privately.
It is to be wished that one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
the London hospitals, not connected with
any existing medical school, should be
reserved for female students and classes
formed in connexion with it. If this
were done, as it probably would be on
the application of a sufficient number of
students, the education of medical women
would be provided for.</p>

<p>The preparation for business is, in most
cases, simply a matter of arrangement,
requiring nothing but the good will and
hearty concurrence of the masters. The
easiest thing would be for fathers to bring
up their daughters to their own business;
and, no doubt, this would often be done,
if custom permitted. It is the fear of
public opinion—of exciting astonishment
and remark—that, probably more than any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
other cause, imposes upon parents what
they feel to be a sort of moral and social
obligation to keep their daughters idle.</p>

<p>In addition to other hindrances in
the way of giving a thorough education
to girls, there is one which presses
heavily on persons of narrow incomes—namely,
its costliness as compared with
that of boys. This is a fact, notwithstanding
the other fact, that the teachers
of girls are, as a rule, much worse paid
than the teachers of boys. It is traceable
to two causes—the absence of endowments,
and the smallness of girls’ schools.
Both these causes are removable.</p>

<p>With regard to endowments, there is
reason to believe that a large proportion
of those which are now appropriated to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
the use of boys were originally intended
for both sexes. The founders do not seem
to have known anything about the modern
theories of separate education, and,
when they established a school, had no
idea of excluding any of ‘the children’ of
the parish or kin which it was designed
to benefit. It is noticeable that, in cases
where girls happen to be expressly mentioned
in the foundation deeds, Latin and
accounts are almost invariably named in
the course of instruction laid down. There
is much difference of opinion as to the permanent
usefulness of endowments. Some
people think they do more harm than good,
and would like to get rid of them altogether.
This seems a somewhat extreme
view; and, at any rate, as the endowments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
exist, something must be done with them.
If it is for the general good that education
should be much more expensive, and, therefore,
much more difficult to get, for a girl
than for a boy; or if the balance is redressed
by greater willingness on the part
of parents to make sacrifices in behalf of
their daughters, it may be well to let the
present distribution stand. But it appears
rather that the education of women is at
present exactly at the stage at which
artificial support is wanted. There are
many ways in which it might be applied.
Probably the most useful at the present
juncture would be the foundation of exhibitions
and scholarships, awarded under
such varying conditions as to give them
the widest possible range. Taking the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
middle classes generally, there seems to
be no reason why they should not pay for
the education of their children at cost
price; but there are many exceptions,
and the legitimate use of all eleemosynary
aid seems to be to meet special cases of
misfortune. For this reason it is desirable
that, besides exhibitions and scholarships
awarded after a competitive examination—which
would act as an encouragement
to industry and ability—there should be
in the hands of governors and trustees a
power of conferring free or assisted education
without competition. Scholarships
might be tenable at elementary schools,
at a college, at a medical school, or at
schools of art; or there might be exhibitions
available for apprenticeship to any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
profession or trade whatsoever, at the discretion
of the trustees.</p>

<p>In the meantime, without any aid from
public sources, a good deal might be done
by a more judicious use of existing means.
The present mode of carrying on girls’
schools involves an enormous waste of
teaching power. Fifteen or twenty girls
absorb a staff amply sufficient for three
or four times the number. This is inevitable
in small schools; and the consequence
follows, that in many boardingschools
for girls the terms are considerably
higher than at Rugby or Harrow. It is
doubtful whether very large boardingschools
would work well; but the difficulty
may be got over in another way,
by establishing a thoroughly good day-school,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
and clustering round it boardinghouses
of moderate size, according to
the demand. In places like Blackheath,
Clapham, St John’s Wood, or in any
locality where girls’ schools congregate,
this plan might be adopted, and would
combine many of the respective advantages
of large and small schools. The
facilities for classification, companionship
in study, healthy public spirit, and a
general kind of open-airiness which go
with large numbers, would be found in
the school. The boardinghouses would
have the quietness and something of the
domestic character which it is difficult to
get in a household conducted on a very large
scale. The popularity of small boardingschools
is probably chiefly owing to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
fancied resemblance to a home circle.
There is an impression that a group of
girls, all about the same age, and without
father or brothers, constitute something
like a family. It is really much more
like a nunnery; and there is reason to
believe that, in a less degree, just those
evils which are said to attach to conventual
life are rife in boardingschools.</p>

<p>A sense of these evils leads some people
to prefer the system of private governesses.
This no doubt has recommendation;
it certainly has serious drawbacks.
Among those which are inevitable is the
effect of a lonely life on the governess.
Without going into sentimental wailings
over her unhappy lot, it must be confessed
that her position is peculiarly isolated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
She spends the greater part of her time
in intercourse with young and immature
minds, only varied by unequal association
with the parents or grown-up brothers
and sisters of her pupils. The society of
her equals in age and position is entirely
wanting, and the natural tendency of such
mental solitude is to produce childishness,
angularity, and narrow-mindedness. It
must be a very strong character indeed
which can do without the wholesome trituration
and the expansive influence of
equal companionship, and this is just what
a governess cannot have. A great effort
may be made to treat her as one of the
family, but she does not really belong to
the people, or even to their class. She
is always a bird of passage, and in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
respect her position is worse than that of
a servant, who, besides having the companionship
of fellowservants, may look
forward to remaining in one family for
life. A governess must always be prepared
to leave when the term of temporary
service expires, and this is in itself an
obstacle to the formation of strong attachments.
And if it is true that the conditions
of governess life have a deteriorating
effect on character, it follows that the
pupils will in a degree more or less be
losers. Whether there may be advantages
or conveniences which more than
compensate for what is lost, is a question
which must be affected by considerations
varying in individual cases. Similarly,
with regard to boardingschools, a first-rate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
mistress may be able to offer certain
advantages attainable in no other way.
The conclusion arrived at goes no farther
than this, that, other things being equal,
a large day-school attended by scholars
living either at home or in small boardinghouses,
has a clear advantage, both as
regards economy and mental and moral
training, over the rival systems of boardingschools
and private governesses. It
follows that in any direct efforts which
may be made for the improvement of
elementary education, the foundation or
strengthening of well conducted day-schools
is the wisest course to adopt.</p>

<p>The foregoing suggestions must of
course be subject to all sorts of modifications,
according to temporary and local<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
necessities. Specific schemes, adapted to
circumstances, will be devised as occasions
arise. In the meantime, any kind of recognition
of the fact that the education of
women is a matter worth thinking about,
is of the utmost practical value. In this
point of view, as indicating and expressing
a growing sense of the importance of the
subject, the extension to girls of the local
examinations of the Universities of Cambridge
and Edinburgh, and the steps taken
by the Schools Inquiry Commission in
their pending investigations, have an indirect
influence quite out of proportion to
the immediate and calculable results obtained,
affording a moral support and
encouragement the effect of which it is
not easy to estimate.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">To</span> guard against misconception on
so obscure and so complex a
subject as that of the present
inquiry is a somewhat hopeless endeavour.
But it may, perhaps, be worth while to
say once more, what has so often been
said already, that those who ask for a
fuller and freer life for women have no
desire to interfere with distinctions of sex.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
The question under debate is not whether,
as a matter of fact, there is such a thing
as distinctive manhood and womanhood;
for that no one denies. The dispute is
rather as to the degree in which certain
qualities, commonly regarded as respectively
masculine and feminine characteristics,
are such intrinsically, or only
conventionally; and further, as to the
degree of prominence which it is desirable
to give to the specific differences
in determining social arrangements. It
is not against the recognition of real distinctions,
but against arbitrary judgments,
not based upon reason, that the protest is
raised. If, in the exigencies of controversy,
expressions may sometimes be used
which seem to involve a denial of differences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
in the respective natures of women
and of men, it must be regarded as a misfortune
for which the advocates of restriction
and suppression are responsible.
When broad assertions are made as to
natural fitness and unfitness, and a course
of action is founded upon them, it becomes
necessary, at least, to ask for proof.
When proof is wanting, it is not unnatural
to fall back upon feeling; and
prejudices, dignified by the name of instincts,
are appealed to as decisive when
rational argument fails. The whole question
is clouded over by this confusing
procedure. The instincts, to which so
much importance is attached, differ in the
most bewildering manner. What one
person’s instinct pronounces lawful and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
becoming, another finds revolting. Assumptions
are made, and a fabric of
argument is built up upon data which
are unverified, and which it is at present
impossible either to verify or absolutely
to contradict. For, until artificial appliances
are removed, we cannot know
anything certainly about the native distinctions.
As to the future, who can
say? It may be that,</p>

<p class="poetry">
‘In the long years liker must they grow,<br />
The man be more of woman, she of man;<br />
He gain in sweetness and in moral height,<br />
Nor lose the wrestling thews that throw the world;<br />
She mental breadth, nor fail in childward care;<br />
More as the double-natured poet each:’<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">or it may be that, when ‘full-summed in
all their powers,’ new shades of unlikeness—refinements
of diversity hitherto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
unimagined—may appear. It is neither
necessary nor expedient to prejudge the
question; and those whose faith in the
reality and permanence of the native distinctions
is the strongest are the least
tempted to make rash assertions on either
side. The excessive apprehensiveness
shown by some people on this point
seems to indicate a deeprooted distrust
in the strength of their position. The
fear betrays a doubt. No one urges that
girls should be denied the use of cold
water, or fresh air, or light, or animal
food, lest they should grow into boys.
Yet that these conditions tend to produce
masculine vigour cannot be denied.
Those who are afraid that a free range
of thought and action would injure the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
delicacy of the female mind, ought, in
consistency, to carry their precautions a
little farther. The atmosphere of a hothouse,
judiciously darkened, abstinence
from exercise, and a vegetarian diet
would have an evident tendency to produce
a sickly delicacy of complexion, to
give languor to the limbs, and feebleness
to the voice, and in every way to make
girls much more unlike their brothers
than they were by nature. And if this
is the object of education, the appropriate
means ought to be used.</p>

<p>In the meantime, a great part of the
difficulties which beset every question
concerning women would be at once removed
by a frank recognition of the fact,
that there is between the sexes a deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
and broad basis of likeness. The hypothesis
that men and women are essentially
and radically different, embarrasses
every discussion. When facts are proved
and admitted, scarcely any progress has
been made, because it is assumed that
their action is modified by their application
to the feminine nature. Conditions
which would certainly make a man happy
or miserable, as the case might be, are
supposed to have a different, if not an
exactly opposite, effect upon a woman.
The theory has been asserted and reasserted
so incessantly, that even women
themselves have been partly persuaded to
believe it. And it is, no doubt, so far
true, that while the education and the
circumstances of women are widely different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
from those of men, every agency
brought to bear upon either must act
somewhat differently. But to create facts,
and then to argue from them as if they
were the result of an unalterable destiny,
is a method which convinces only so long
as it is enforced by prejudice. ‘Chacun
selon sa capacité’—‘à chaque producteur
l’ouvrage auquel il est propre’—these
are maxims of unquestioned validity. But
who shall say for another—much more,
who shall say for half the human race—this,
or this, is the measure of your
capacity; this, and no other, is the work
you are qualified to perform? ‘Women’s
work,’ it is said, ‘is helping work.’ Certainly
it is. And is it men’s work to
hinder? The vague information that women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
are to be ministering angels is no
answer to the practical questions, Whom
are they to help, and how? The easy
solution, that it is their nature to do
what men cannot do, or cannot do so
well, has never been adopted in practice,
inasmuch as everything in the world that
there is to do, the care of infants alone
excepted, men are doing; and there is
nothing that a trained man cannot do
better than an untrained woman. Literature
and art, teaching, nursing, cooking,
sewing—these are the recognised feminine
occupations, and they are all shared by
men. The pursuit of them does not turn
men into women, or women into men.
Miss Yonge and Mrs Oliphant ‘help’
Mr Trollope in supplying the world with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
novels; and it is not thought necessary
to guard either party from writing masculine
or feminine novels respectively.
Schoolmasters and schoolmistresses do not
come into unseemly rivalry, although women
teach boys and men teach girls.
By and by it will be found equally
superfluous to prescribe limitations in
any department of thought or industry.</p>

<p>It can scarcely be necessary to discuss at
length the difficulty expressed in the frequent
question,—if women take to doing
men’s work, what are men to do? Will
not the intrusion of women into professions
and trades already overcrowded,
lower the current rate of wages, and by
thus making men less able to support
their families—in the long run, do more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
harm than good? As to the manner and
degree in which the labour-market might
be affected by such a readjustment as is
proposed, it is difficult to predict anything
with certainty. It is impossible to
tell beforehand how many women would
take to what is called (by a very conspicuous
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">petitio principii</i>) men’s work,
and how large a portion of their lives
they would devote to it. If women,
already destined to work for their bread,
chose to earn it in some hitherto unaccustomed
way, it is obvious that in the
exact measure in which their entrance
into a new profession reduced the rate
of wages in that particular calling, it
would tend to raise it in some other
which they would have otherwise pursued,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
and the balance would thus be
redressed. If, on the other hand, women
are not supporting themselves, they are
being supported by somebody else, consuming
either present earnings or accumulated
savings. To keep them from
earning money does not prevent their
spending it. Let us suppose the event,
not a very probable one, that the introduction
of women into the medical profession
would lower the average rate of
remuneration by one-third, in which case
the professional income of an ordinary
medical man would be lessened in the
same proportion. Let us suppose, also—a
not at all improbable case—that the
doctor’s wife, or sister, or daughter,
would earn, in the practice of <em>her</em> profession,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
a sum equivalent to the one-third
he has lost. Evidently, the doctor
and his family would be where they
were, neither better nor worse off than
before. In the meantime, the public
would be so much the richer by getting
its medical attendance one-third cheaper.
Whatever might be the temporary effect
of opening any particular profession to
women, one thing is certain, it can never
be for the interest of society, in a purely
economical aspect, to keep any class of
its members in idleness. A man who
should carry one of his arms in a sling,
in order to secure greater efficiency and
importance to the other, would be regarded
as a lunatic. The one free member
might very probably gain a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
extra dexterity, of an abnormal sort, but
that the man would be on the whole a
loser, is obvious. The case of the body
politic is precisely analogous. The economical
argument is all in favour of
setting everybody to work. Such difficulties
as exist are of a moral or æsthetic
nature, and require for their disentanglement
considerations of a different sort
from those which govern the comparatively
easy economical question.</p>

<p>Much misapprehension has probably
arisen from a confusion between a
standard or law of life and the persons
to whom it is applied. A standard or
law says nothing about the character of
the persons who are expected to conform
to it. It pronounces no opinion upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
their nature beyond what is implied in
assuming it to be not impossible for them
to live by it. The command, ‘Thou
shalt love the Lord thy God with all
thy heart, and thy neighbour as thyself,’
implies that such love is possible to
men; but it may be manifested in countless
ways—in heroic conflict or in patient
endurance, in passionate ardour or meek
submission. If it be true that certain
gifts and graces are specially congenial
to the masculine or feminine nature, the
presentation of a common standard will
draw them out according to their kind,
without the risk of seeming to dispense
with the less easy virtues. Just as when
you plant two rose-trees in the same
ground, you imply the belief that certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
general conditions of soil and atmosphere
are good for both, but you make no
attempt to influence variations of colour
or of perfume; so the Christian theory
of education implies an essential resemblance
between the sexes, without interfering
in any way with native differences.
If, indeed, you adopt the analogy, not
without a certain fanciful charm, according
to which men are trees and women
flowers, the separate system is right.
You do wisely to plant the oak in the
forest, and to shelter the delicate geranium
in the hothouse. But this view
implies that men and women are of a
different genus, which no one in his
senses would maintain. The popular
simile of the oak and the ivy is equally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
untenable. Advocates on both sides are
apt to talk as if men and women were
distinct races, handing down their respective
characteristics from generation
to generation. The fact is, as every one
knows, that hereditary qualities are transmitted
from father to daughter, and from
mother to son, with much impartiality.
The influences tending to create dissimilarity,
which, in our day at least, are at
work, without a moment’s intermission,
from the cradle to the grave, are incessantly
neutralised in each successive generation.
If it were not so, it is difficult
to imagine what the human race would
become. One thing is certain, it would
very soon cease to be human.</p>

<p>Writers on this subject commonly adopt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
somewhat of a threatening tone in reference
to any proposed change. They warn
women that if the oak and ivy theory is
given up, what is called the old chivalry
will die out, and they must no longer
expect to be protected. And it is further
urged that men would suffer, no less than
women, from the absence of any demand
upon their protective instincts. We are
indebted to Mr Kingsley for a very clear
and moderate statement of this view in a
chapter of ‘The Roman and the Teuton’
on the Lombard Laws.</p>

<p>‘It is to be remarked,’ he says, ‘that
no free woman can live in Lombardy, or,
I believe, in any Teutonic state, save
under the “mundium” of some one. You
should understand this word “mund.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
Among most of the Teutonic races, women,
slaves and youths, at least not of age to
carry arms, were under the mund of some
one. Of course, primarily the father, head
of the family, and if he died, an uncle,
elder brother, &amp;c. The married woman
was, of course, under the mund of her
husband. He was answerable for the
good conduct of all under his mund; he
had to pay their fines if they offended;
and he was bound, on the other hand, to
protect them by all lawful means.</p>

<p>‘This system still lingers in the legal
status of women in England, for good and
evil; the husband is more or less answerable
for the wife’s debts; the wife, till
lately, was unable to gain property apart
from her husband’s control; the wife is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
supposed, in certain cases of law, to act
under the husband’s compulsion. All
these, and many others, are relics of the
old system of mund for women; and that
system has, I verily believe, succeeded. It
has called out, as no other system could
have done, chivalry in the man. It has
made him feel it a duty and an honour to
protect the physically weaker sex. It has
made the woman feel that her influence,
whether in the state or in the family, is
to be not physical and legal, but moral
and spiritual; and that it therefore rests
on a ground really nobler and deeper than
that of the man. The modern experiments
for emancipating women from all
mund, and placing them on a physical and
legal equality with the man, may be right,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
and may be ultimately successful. We
must not hastily prejudge them. But of
this we may be almost certain, that, if
they succeed, they will cause a wide-spread
revolution in society, of which the patent
danger will be, the destruction of the feeling
of chivalry, and the consequent brutalisation
of the male sex.’</p>

<p>These are terrible warnings, and may
well make any one hesitate in lifting a
finger to aid in a revolution charged with
such disastrous possibilities. But is it
really true that the male sex is likely to be
brutalised by learning that a man must no
longer rely upon physical and legal influence,
but must rest his claims to allegiance
on a moral and spiritual basis? Is it good
for a man to feel that his influence rests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
on a ground less noble and deep than that
of women, and to satisfy himself with a
lower moral position? The mund system
may have succeeded,—in other words, it
may have been the best thing possible, in
a rude and barbarous age, when serfdom
also was in full force and ‘succeeded’ in
its way—a time when force was met by
force, and individual protection was a
surer resource than that of law. But
even as applying to those days, the success
of the system seems to have been
somewhat incomplete. How it worked—or
failed to work—Mr Kingsley shows in
a few graphic lines, in his recent tale,
‘Hereward.’ Describing the fate of the
little Torfrida, his hero’s daughter, he
tells us, that ‘she was married to Hugh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
of Evermue, who is not said to have
kicked her; and was, according to them
of Crowland, a good friend to their monastery,
and therefore, doubtless, a good
man. Once, says wicked report, he offered
to strike her, as was the fashion in those
chivalrous days. Whereon she turned
upon him like a tigress, and bidding him
remember that she was the daughter of
Hereward and Torfrida, gave him such a
beating, that he, not wishing to draw
sword upon her, surrendered at discretion;
and they lived all their lives afterwards
as happily as most other people in those
times.’</p>

<p>Mr Gladstone lays down, that ‘as the
law of force is the law of the brute creation,
so in proportion as he is under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
yoke of that law does man approximate
to the brute; and in proportion, on the
other hand, as he has escaped from its
dominion, is he ascending into the higher
sphere of being and claiming relationship
with Deity. But the emancipation and
due ascendancy of women are not a mere
fact: they are the emphatic assertion of a
principle; and that principle is the dethronement
of the law of force, and the
enthronement of other and higher laws in
its place, and in its despite.’ The advocates
of the protective theory seem scarcely
to have realised that the idea of protection
implies the corresponding idea of
attack. It assumes, as part of its essence,
that somebody is attacking, or what
occasion would there be for defence?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
Might it not be well for everybody to
abandon the attitude of attack? To
assert that in a civilised country women
want such protection as any human arm
can give, is a contradiction in terms. It
is supposing, either that the law permits
outrages upon the defenceless, or that it
can be broken with impunity. That we
in England are as yet only partially
emerged from barbarism is indeed true.
The time-honoured customs handed down
from the days of Hugh of Evermue have
not yet disappeared, and cases of assault,
almost invariably committed by the natural
protector, are not uncommon in
English households. But the law undertakes
to interfere—and does interfere,
though as yet in a somewhat impotent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
manner—for the defence of hapless wives
and children. It can scarcely be the true
policy of an age which professes to be
enlightened and humane, to suffer general
licence to prevail, in order that a few rare
souls, able to be a law to themselves and
other people, may have the occasion for
displaying exceptional heroism. If the
scheme of Divine Providence requires
that there should be outlets for the protective
energies, they are likely to be
found for a long time yet, in the infirmities
of age, of infancy, and of poverty,
without encouraging morbid or affected
weakness in human beings intended by
nature to be healthy and strong. There
is still plenty of fighting to do, though
the progress of civilisation has removed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
the warfare into new fields, and demands
new weapons. Evil now appears in a
subtle, intangible shape, against which
physical strength is of little avail. But
the generosity and the courage which
constituted the true beauty and worth of
chivalry can never become obsolete. The
chivalrous spirit now shows itself in the
abandonment of unjust privileges, in the
enactment of equal laws, and in facing
ridicule, opposition, and discouragement
in behalf of unpopular ideas. The great
battle between good and evil is for ever
going on. The form is renewed from age
to age, but the spirit is the same. Let us
take care lest, in clinging to forms from
which the spirit has departed, in shutting
our eyes to keep out the dawning day, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
may be blindly fighting the battle of the
Philistines, all unwittingly ranged among
the enemies of the cause we desire to
serve.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
